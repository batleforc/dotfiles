# Batleforc's Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles and configuration files for various applications and tools that I use on my systems. Keep in mind that most of these configurations are tailored to be used with [Chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io/), a popular dotfile management tool and my atomic OS [Weebo-os](https://github.com/batleforc/weebo-os).

## Contents

- **Shell Configurations**: Custom configurations for Bash, Starship, and other tools.
- **Editor Configurations**:
  - Settings for Neovim, including plugins and themes like the LazyVim setup.
  - Configurations for VSCode.

## TODO

- Auto Install the [FiraCode Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.4.0/FiraCode.zip) if not present.
- Add more detailed documentation for each configuration file.
- Include installation scripts for setting up the environment quickly.

### FiraCode Nerd Font Installation

Look if [Che copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/che/nerd-fonts/) work properly with vsode and ghostty to install FiraCode Nerd Font automatically. if not just download and unzip it to the fonts directory.
